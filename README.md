# Superhero Manager

Simple app to demonstrate supehero managment.

This repository contains two main folders: `humble-superhero-api` and `superhero-client`. Below are the instructions on how to start them.

## Project Setup

### humble-superhero-api

Navigate to the `humble-superhero-api` directory:
   ```bash
   cd humble-superhero-api
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

### superhero-client

Navigate to the `superhero-client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd superhero-client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Improvements

I would:
- schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress
- suggest more traits to put for superheroes


### If I had more time

If I had more time, I would:

- implement automated tests for both the backend and frontend to ensure code quality
- add Docker to simplify the setup process
- add more features to the application, such as user authentication and authorization, better UI...
